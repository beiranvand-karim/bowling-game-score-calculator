## developer comments 
here are few improvements that can be done to make project better. I skipped them to speed up the development.
- UI styling and layouting could still be improved a bit more.
- Form validation could also be improved to be very nice.
- Code for form validation can be improved. It's not the optimalist code now.
- I turned off typescript strict mode to speed up, so there is room for improvement there as well
